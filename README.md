My First Portfolio

Hello! I am a beginner in web design and development. I am currently learning and improving my skills, and this is my first personal portfolio built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Technologies I'm Using:

HTML – for structuring and content of the website

CSS – for styling and responsive design

JavaScript – for basic interactive elements

Tools I'm Working With:

Visual Studio Code – for writing and editing code

GitHub – for publishing and version control of my work

Current Status

I'm currently focusing on mastering fundamental concepts in front-end development. This project marks the beginning of my journey, and I plan to add new features and content as I continue learning.

Any feedback is greatly appreciated!

Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile!
